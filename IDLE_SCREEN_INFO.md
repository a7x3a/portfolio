## How It Works

### Activity Detection
The screen monitors these events:
- `mousedown` - Mouse clicks
- `mousemove` - Mouse movement
- `keypress` - Keyboard input
- `scroll` - Page scrolling
- `touchstart` - Touch on mobile
- `click` - Any clicks

### Timer Logic
1. User visits the site â†’ Timer starts (30s)
2. No activity for 30s â†’ Idle screen appears with random quote
3. User interacts â†’ Screen dismisses, timer resets
4. Repeat

## Customization

### Change Idle Time
Edit `src/components/IdleScreen.jsx`, line 110 & 128:
```javascript
}, 30000); // 30 seconds (in milliseconds)
```
Change `30000` to your preferred time (e.g., `60000` for 1 minute)

### Add More Quotes
Edit the `quotes` array in `src/components/IdleScreen.jsx`:
```javascript
const quotes = [
  {
    text: "Your quote here",
    author: "Author Name"
  },
  // Add more...
];
```

### Disable Feature
Remove or comment out this line in `src/App.jsx`:
```javascript
<IdleScreen />
```
